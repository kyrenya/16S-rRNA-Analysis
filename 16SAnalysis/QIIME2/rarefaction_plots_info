The visualization will have two plots. 
The top plot is an alpha rarefaction plot,
 and is primarily used to determine if the richness of the samples
 has been fully observed or sequenced. If the lines in the plot appear to “level out”
 (i.e., approach a slope of zero) at some sampling depth along the x-axis,
 that suggests that collecting additional sequences beyond that sampling depth 
would not be likely to result in the observation of additional features. 
If the lines in a plot don’t level out, this may be because the richness of the samples 
hasn’t been fully observed yet (because too few sequences were collected), 
or it could be an indicator that a lot of sequencing error remains in the data 
(which is being mistaken for novel diversity).

The bottom plot in this visualization is important when grouping samples by metadata. 
It illustrates the number of samples that remain in each group when the feature table is 
rarefied to each sampling depth. If a given sampling depth d is larger than the total frequency
 of a sample s (i.e., the number of sequences that were obtained for sample s),
 it is not possible to compute the diversity metric for sample s at sampling depth d. 
If many of the samples in a group have lower total frequencies than d, the average diversity
 presented for that group at d in the top plot will be unreliable because it will have been 
computed on relatively few samples. When grouping samples by metadata, 
it is therefore essential to look at the bottom plot to ensure that the data presented in the top plot is reliable.
